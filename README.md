we have already transfered the cascade file from opencv into the same directory as your python file. 
you have to paste all your images in the folder "images"[you have to create the folder name image], inside the folder you your "Yourname"-you have to put yourname there.

then run the facetrain.py for training the the data using numpy.
then finally you have to run the opencv.py for face detection.
